## **📁 Dashboards Folder**  

This folder contains **visual dashboards** created using **Tableau, Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn), or Google Colab** to present key insights from the **Superstore dataset**.  

### **📌 Guidelines:**  
- Organize dashboards by **theme or analysis type** (e.g., `sales_dashboard.twb`, `customer_insights_dashboard.ipynb`).  
- Ensure **clarity and usability** by including labels, legends, and tooltips.  
- Add a **README or documentation** for each dashboard explaining its purpose and key takeaways.  

### **⚠️ Notes:**  
- If modifying existing dashboards, use **GitHub branches and Pull Requests** for version control.  
- Large files should be shared via **Git LFS or external links** to avoid exceeding repo size limits.
