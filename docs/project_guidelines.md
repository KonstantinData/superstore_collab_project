# **Project Guidelines – Superstore Data Analysis**

Welcome to the **Superstore Data Analysis Project**! These guidelines will help ensure a smooth collaboration and maintain a structured workflow.

## **📌 How to Get Started**
1. **Request Access:** Contact the project owner to be invited to the repository.
2. **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the project on GitHub.
3. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone <repo_url>` to work locally.
4. **Create a Branch:** Work on a separate branch for each new feature or analysis (`git checkout -b feature_branch`).

## **📁 Repository Structure**
```
/data              # Superstore dataset (CSV format)
/sql_queries       # SQL scripts for analysis
/notebooks         # Jupyter Notebooks for Python analysis
/dashboards        # Tableau/Colab dashboards & visualizations
/docs              # Documentation & insights

## **🔄 Collaboration Workflow**
✅ **Always work on a branch** before making changes to the main repository.  
✅ **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** when your work is ready for review.  
✅ **Use GitHub Issues** to discuss challenges or suggest improvements.  
✅ **Provide clear commit messages** explaining your changes (`git commit -m "Added sales analysis notebook"`).

## **📊 Best Practices**
🔹 **Code Clarity:** Write clean and well-commented code.  
🔹 **Documentation:** Use markdown (`.md`) files to explain analysis steps.  
🔹 **Data Integrity:** Avoid modifying the original dataset; create transformed versions if needed.  
🔹 **Visualization Standards:** Ensure dashboards and charts are easy to interpret.
