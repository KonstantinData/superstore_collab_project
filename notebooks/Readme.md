## **📁 Notebooks Folder**  

This folder contains:
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Contains notebooks for in-depth data analysis.
  - **Data Cleaning Notebook:**
    - **Example:** Demonstrates techniques for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats using Pandas.
  - **Data Transformation Notebook:**
    - **Example:** Shows how to reshape data, merge multiple sources, and engineer new features to enhance the dataset.
  - **Data Visualization Notebook:**
    - **Example:** Provides examples for creating various charts (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps) with libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
  - **Statistical Analysis Notebook:**
    - **Example:** Illustrates methods for performing regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and correlation studies on the Superstore dataset.


### **📌 Guidelines:**  
- Use **clear and structured markdown cells** to explain your analysis.  
- Organize notebooks by **topic or analysis type** (e.g., `sales_analysis.ipynb`, `customer_segmentation.ipynb`).  
- Include **code comments** to clarify logic and assumptions.  

### **⚠️ Notes:**  
- Avoid pushing large datasets inside notebooks—keep data processing efficient.  
- If modifying existing notebooks, create a **new branch and submit a Pull Request** for review.
