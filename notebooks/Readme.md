## **📁 Notebooks Folder**  

This folder contains **Jupyter Notebooks** for in-depth data analysis using **Python**. The notebooks include data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and statistical analysis based on the **Superstore dataset**.  

### **📌 Guidelines:**  
- Use **clear and structured markdown cells** to explain your analysis.  
- Organize notebooks by **topic or analysis type** (e.g., `sales_analysis.ipynb`, `customer_segmentation.ipynb`).  
- Include **code comments** to clarify logic and assumptions.  

### **⚠️ Notes:**  
- Avoid pushing large datasets inside notebooks—keep data processing efficient.  
- If modifying existing notebooks, create a **new branch and submit a Pull Request** for review.
