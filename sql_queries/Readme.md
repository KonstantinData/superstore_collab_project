## **📁 SQL Queries Folder**  

This folder contains **SQL scripts** for querying and analyzing the **Superstore dataset**. The queries are used for **data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and business insights.**  

### **📌 Guidelines:**  
- Organize queries by **use case** (e.g., sales analysis, customer segmentation, performance trends).  
- Use **clear and descriptive filenames** (e.g., `sales_trends.sql`, `top_customers.sql`).  
- Add **comments in SQL scripts** to explain logic and assumptions.  

### **⚠️ Notes:**  
- Ensure queries are **optimized for performance** before committing.  
- If modifying existing queries, use **GitHub branches and Pull Requests** for collaboration.
